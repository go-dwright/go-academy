VARIABLES
=========

This lab we will be looking into variables and how to use them as part of a static compiled language.

BUILDING & RUNNING
------------------

Ensure your terminal is in this directory then you can either build and execute by using the following commands:
```
go build -o app . 
./app
``` 
You can also run the shorthand command which compiles and runs the code without creating a compiled file:
```
go run .
```
