HELLO WORLD
===========

The first program we all write is hello world and this will be no different.  

BUILDING & RUNNING
------------------

Ensure your terminal is in this directory then you can either build and execute by using the following commands:
```
go build -o app . 
./app
``` 
You can also run the shorthand command which compiles and runs the code without creating a compiled file:
```
go run .
```
