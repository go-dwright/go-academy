GOLANG
======

This repo is to store a set of labs to help get started with golang. The offical guide to Golang is also very useful for learning the language
That is available here: https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

GETTING STARTED
===============

Go should be installed using the official guidance available from https://go.dev/doc/install

To check that it has been installed correctly run the following command

```
> go version
go version go1.15.7 darwin/amd64
```
